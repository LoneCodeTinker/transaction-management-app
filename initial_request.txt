#new I want to create a web app that has tabs for transaction types (sales, Purchases, expense)

the first section of the tab:
has fields for a name of a vendor or customer depending on the tab, and date of transaction, description, reference number, amount, VAT, total amount with VAT... and a save button adds the transaction to an excel workbook in a sheet according to the transaction type

second section:
check boxes for list of actions needs to be taken to the transaction for example: scanned the bill, registered in the system, paid?, registered the payment in the system... 

third section:
has a list of all transactions that can be clicked to view the transaction status..
if all check boxes are checked the transaction moved to done list which should be all the way down or there's another button to show the done transactions among the list

how can we build this project?
